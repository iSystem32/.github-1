## Example Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    # ...
    steps:
      # ...
      - name: Import Secrets
        id: import-secrets
        uses: hashicorp/vault-action@v2
        with:
          url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
          token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
          caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
          secrets: |
            secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
            secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;
            secret/data/ci npm_token
      # ...
```

Retrieved secrets are available as environment variables or outputs for subsequent steps:

```yaml
#...
- name: Step following 'Import Secrets'
  run: |
    ACCESS_KEY_ID = "${{ env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}"
    SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = "${{ steps.import-secrets.outputs.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}"

# ...
```

If your project needs a format other than env vars and step outputs, you can use additional steps to transform them into the desired format.
For example, a common pattern is to save all the secrets in a JSON file:

```yaml
#...
- name: Step following 'Import Secrets'
  run: |
    touch secrets.json
    echo '${{ toJson(steps.import-secrets.outputs) }}' >> secrets.json

# ...
```

Which with our example would yield a file containing:

```json
{
  "ACCESS_KEY_ID": "MY_KEY_ID",
  "SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "MY_SECRET_KEY",
  "NPM_TOKEN": "MY_NPM_TOKEN"
}
```

Note that all secrets are masked so programs need to read the file themselves otherwise all values will be replaced with a `***` placeholder.

## Authentication Methods

Consider using a [Vault authentication method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth) such as the JWT auth method with
[GitHub OIDC tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) or the AppRole auth method. You can configure which by using the `method` parameter.

### JWT with GitHub OIDC Tokens

You can configure trust between a GitHub Actions workflow
and Vault using the
[GitHub's OIDC provider](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect).
Each GitHub Actions workflow receives an auto-generated OIDC token with claims
to establish the identity of the workflow.

**Vault Configuration**

<details>
<summary>Click to toggle instructions for configuring Vault.</summary>

Set up Vault with the [JWT auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#configure).
Pass the following parameters to your auth method configuration:

- `oidc_discovery_url`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`
- `bound_issuer`: `https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com`

Configure a [Vault role](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/auth/jwt#create-role) for the auth method.

- `role_type`: `jwt`

- `bound_audiences`: `"https://github.com/<org>"`. Update this parameter if
  you change the `aud` claim in the GitHub OIDC token via the
  `jwtGithubAudience` parameter in the action config.

- `user_claim`: Set this to a claim name (e.g., `repository`) in the
  [GitHub OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#understanding-the-oidc-token).

- `bound_claims` OR `bound_subject`: match on [GitHub subject claims](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect#example-subject-claims).

  - For wildcard (non-exact) matches, use `bound_claims`.

    - `bound_claims_type`: `glob`

    - `bound_claims`: JSON object. Maps one or more claim names to corresponding wildcard values.
      ```json
      { "sub": "repo:<orgName>/*" }
      ```

  - For exact matches, use `bound_subject`.

    - `bound_claims_type`: `string`

    - `bound_subject`: Must exactly match the `sub` claim in the OIDC token.
      ```plaintext
      repo:<orgName/repoName>:ref:refs/heads/branchName
      ```

</details>

**GitHub Actions Workflow**

In the GitHub Actions workflow, the workflow needs permissions to read contents
and write the ID token.

```yaml
jobs:
  retrieve-secret:
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
```

In the action, provide the name of the Vault role you created to the `role` parameter.
You can optionally set the `jwtGithubAudience` parameter to change the `aud`
claim from its default.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  role: <Vault JWT Auth Role Name>
  method: jwt
  jwtGithubAudience: sigstore # set the GitHub token's aud claim
```

### AppRole

The [AppRole auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a pre-defined role.
Set the role ID and secret ID as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`roleId` and `secretId` parameters.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: approle
  roleId: ${{ secrets.VAULT_ROLE_ID }}
  secretId: ${{ secrets.VAULT_SECRET_ID }}
```

### Token

For the default method of authenticating to Vault,
use a [Vault token](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/tokens).
Set the Vault token as a GitHub secret and pass
it to the `token` parameter.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
```

### GitHub

The [GitHub auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/github)
requires `read:org` permissions for authentication. The auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN`
created for projects does not have these permissions and GitHub does not allow this
token's permissions to be modified. A new GitHub Token secret must be created with
`read:org` permissions to use this authentication method.

Pass the GitHub token as a GitHub secret into the `githubToken` parameter.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: github
  githubToken: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### JWT with OIDC Provider

You can configure trust between your own OIDC Provider and Vault
with the JWT auth method. Provide a `role` & `jwtPrivateKey` parameters,
additionally you can pass `jwtKeyPassword` & `jwtTtl` parameters

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: jwt
  role: <Vault JWT Auth Role Name>
  jwtPrivateKey: ${{ secrets.JWT_PRIVATE_KEY }}
  jwtKeyPassword: ${{ secrets.JWT_KEY_PASS }}
  jwtTtl: 3600 # 1 hour, default value
```

### Kubernetes

Consider the [Kubernetes auth method](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/kubernetes)
when using self-hosted runners on Kubernetes. You must provide the `role` parameter
for the Vault role associated with the Kubernetes auth method.
You can optionally override the `kubernetesTokenPath` parameter for
custom-mounted serviceAccounts.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: kubernetes
  role: <Vault Kubernetes Auth Role Name>
  kubernetesTokenPath: /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token # default token path
```

### Userpass

The [Userpass auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/userpass) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password.
Set the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`username` and `password` parameters.

This is not the same as ldap or okta auth methods.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: userpass
  username: ${{ secrets.VAULT_USERNAME }}
  password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASSWORD }}
```

### Ldap

The [LDAP auth method](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/auth/ldap) allows
your GitHub Actions workflow to authenticate to Vault with a username and password inturn verfied with ldap servers.
Set the username and password as GitHub secrets and pass them to the
`username` and `password` parameters.

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  method: ldap
  username: ${{ secrets.VAULT_USERNAME }}
  password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASSWORD }}
```

### Other Auth Methods

If any other method is specified and you provide an `authPayload`, the action will
attempt to `POST` to `auth/${method}/login` with the provided payload and parse out the client token.

### Custom Path Name

Auth methods at custom path names can be configured using the [`path`](#path) parameter

```yaml
with:
  url: https://vault.mycompany.com:8200
  caCertificate: ${{ secrets.VAULT_CA_CERT }}
  path: my-custom-path
  method: userpass
  username: ${{ secrets.VAULT_USERNAME }}
  password: ${{ secrets.VAULT_PASSWORD }}
```

## Key Syntax

The `secrets` parameter is a set of multiple secret requests separated by the `;` character.

Each secret request consists of the `path` and the `key` of the desired secret, and optionally the desired Env Var output name.
Note that the selector is using [JSONata](https://docs.jsonata.org/overview.html) and certain characters in keys may need to be escaped.

```raw
{{ Secret Path }} {{ Secret Key or Selector }} | {{ Env/Output Variable Name }}
```

### Simple Key

To retrieve a key `npmToken` from path `secret/data/ci` that has value `somelongtoken` from vault you could do:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: secret/data/ci npmToken
```

`vault-action` will automatically normalize the given secret selector key, and set the follow as environment variables for the following steps in the current job:

```bash
NPMTOKEN=somelongtoken
```

You can also access the secret via outputs:

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    id: secrets
    # Import config...
  - name: Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.npmToken }}'"
```

_**Note:** If you'd like to only use outputs and disable automatic environment variables, you can set the `exportEnv` option to `false`._

### Set Output Variable Name

However, if you want to set it to a specific name, say `NPM_TOKEN`, you could do this instead:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: secret/data/ci npmToken | NPM_TOKEN
```

With that, `vault-action` will now use your requested name and output:

```bash
NPM_TOKEN=somelongtoken
```

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    id: secrets
    # Import config...
  - name: Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.NPM_TOKEN }}'"
```

### Multiple Secrets

This action can take multi-line input, so say you had your AWS keys stored in a path and wanted to retrieve both of them. You can do:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: |
    secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
    secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```

You can specify a wildcard \* for the key name to get all keys in the path. If you provide an output name with the wildcard, the name will be prepended to the key name:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: |
    secret/data/ci/aws * | MYAPP_ ;
```

When using the `exportEnv` option all exported keys will be normalized to uppercase. For example, the key `SecretKey` would be exported as `MYAPP_SECRETKEY`.
You can disable uppercase normalization by specifying double asterisks `**` in the selector path:

```yaml
with:
    secrets: |
        secret/data/ci/aws ** | MYAPP_ ;
```

### KV secrets engine version 2

When accessing secrets from the KV secrets engine version 2, Vault Action
requires the full path to the secret. This is the same path that would be used
in a Vault policy for the secret. You can find the full path to your secret by
performing a `kv get` command like the following:

```bash
$ vault kv get secret/test
== Secret Path ==
secret/data/test

...
```

Note that the full path is not `secret/test`, but `secret/data/test`.

## PKI Certificate Requests

You can use the `pki` option to generate a certificate and private key for a given role.

````yaml
with:
    pki: |
        pki/issue/rolename {"common_name": "role.mydomain.com", "ttl": "1h"} ;
        pki/issue/otherrole {"common_name": "otherrole.mydomain.com", "ttl": "1h"} ;
```

Resulting in:

```bash
ROLENAME_CA=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
ROLENAME_CERT=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
ROLENAME_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...
ROLENAME_CA_CHAIN=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
OTHERROLE_CA=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
OTHERROLE_CERT=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
OTHERROLE_KEY=-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----...
OTHERROLE_CA_CHAIN=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...
````

## Other Secret Engines

Vault Action currently supports retrieving secrets from any engine where secrets
are retrieved via `GET` requests, except for the PKI engine as noted above.

For example, to request a secret from the `cubbyhole` secret engine:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: |
    /cubbyhole/foo foo ;
    /cubbyhole/foo zip | MY_KEY ;
```

Resulting in:

```bash
FOO=bar
MY_KEY=zap
```

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    id: secrets
    # Import config...
  - name: Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.foo }}'"
  - name: Another Sensitive Operation
    run: "my-cli --token '${{ steps.secrets.outputs.MY_KEY }}'"
```

## Adding Extra Headers

If you ever need to add extra headers to the vault request, say if you need to authenticate with a firewall, all you need to do is set `extraHeaders`:

```yaml
with:
  secrets: |
    secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
    secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  extraHeaders: |
    X-Secure-Id: ${{ secrets.SECURE_ID }}
    X-Secure-Secret: ${{ secrets.SECURE_SECRET }}
```

This will automatically add the `x-secure-id` and `x-secure-secret` headers to every request to Vault.

## HashiCorp Cloud Platform or Vault Enterprise

If you are using [HCP Vault](https://cloud.hashicorp.com/products/vault)
or Vault Enterprise, you may need additional parameters in
your GitHub Actions workflow.

### Namespace

If you need to retrieve secrets from a specific Vault namespace, set the `namespace`
parameter specifying the namespace. In HCP Vault, the namespace defaults to `admin`.

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    uses: hashicorp/vault-action
    with:
      url: https://vault-enterprise.mycompany.com:8200
      method: token
      token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
      namespace: admin
      secrets: |
        secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
        secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;
        secret/data/ci npm_token
```

Alternatively, you may need to authenticate to the root namespace and retrieve
a secret from a different namespace. To do this, do not set the `namespace`
parameter. Instead set the namespace in the secret path. For example, `<NAMESPACE>/secret/data/app`:

```yaml
steps:
  # ...
  - name: Import Secrets
    uses: hashicorp/vault-action
    with:
      url: https://vault-enterprise.mycompany.com:8200
      method: token
      token: ${{ secrets.VAULT_TOKEN }}
      secrets: |
        namespace-1/secret/data/ci/aws accessKey | AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID ;
        namespace-1/secret/data/ci/aws secretKey | AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY ;
        namespace-1/secret/data/ci npm_token
```

License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
Form.

3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and

(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.

3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
License(s).

3.4. Notices

You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.

3.5. Application of Additional Terms

You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
jurisdiction.

4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.

5. Termination
--------------

5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
Your receipt of the notice.

5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
2.1 of this License shall terminate.

5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
prior to termination shall survive termination.

Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
cross-claims or counter-claims.

9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
